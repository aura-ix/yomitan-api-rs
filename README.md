# yomitan-api-rs
An implementation of the native messaging component and it's installer for yomitan. Functions identically to [the official yomitan-api](github.com/yomidevs/yomitan-api), but removes the python dependency.

# Tested platforms
- Firefox, macOS 26.2
- Firefox, Windows 11

Please open an issue or pull request if you have successfully installed it on another platform!

## TODO

- Monolithic installation binary
- Github actions executables
