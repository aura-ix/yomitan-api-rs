Due to this app not being signed with a developer ID, you will have to perform the following steps:

1) Try to open the app as normal, and it will tell you that you cannot open it because it is not signed.
2) Close the dialog.
3) Open system settings, navigate to the "Privacy & Security" section, then scroll all the way down to the security section.
4) Click "Open Anyway" where it says: "Yomitan API (rs) Installer" was blocked to protect your Mac

This is neccessary due to signing an app requiring a $99/year subscription on macOS.
